## KiCAD 6.x board with two FAN3852 analog to digital converters (ADCs).  

## Features

* Converts analog audio and ultrasound signals into digital Pulse Density (PDM) format
* jumper selection for different options
* accepts analog input signals from SMA connectors, jumper wire, or 3.5mm (1/8") stereo jack
* On-board low noise (LT3042) voltage regulator powered from USB Micro 

* Board can be (mostly) assembled by JLCPCB (only U2 and UJ3 FAN3852 and J16 CUI SJ-3523-SMT audio jack need hand soldering)
* much cheaper than OnSemi FAN3852 EVB 

## Equipment Required

* USB Micro cable for 5V power
* Analog source
* SMA and/or jumper wires to connect test equipment
* 3.5mm male stereo jack if using audio input
* PDMCLK source/PDMDAT Sink
